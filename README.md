# Privacy Policy

In an effort of transparency, here's a list of what Tweeter stores. Everything in this list is necessary for Tweeter to function. None of the data described here is **never** being sold to anyone.

In the database on our own server, which we only have access too:
- **Twitter IDs**, **screen names**, and **usernames** of accounts your followed to. 
- **Guild IDs** and **Channel IDs** of your server. So Tweeter knows where to send the tweet.

Some additional info is displayed in logs for debugging purposes:
- **Guild names** and **Channel names**.

Since Tweeter has access to both Twitter and Discord's APIs there is *a lot* more data Tweeter can access, like every Discord bot, including but not limited to every single message that's in channels Tweeter has access to & the tag of every single user in servers, however **we do not ever access or store that data**.
